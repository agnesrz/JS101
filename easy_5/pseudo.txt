****************** Exercise 1 ****************** 
input: an angle between 0 and 360 degrees
output: the representation of the angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds
rules:
  -fuction should take a floating point number
  -use a degree symbol (˚) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds
  -There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute
formula:
  -degree = positive integer part of the input
  -minutes = (input - degrees) * 60 
  -seconds = (input - degrees - (minutes/60) * 3600     OR     decimal amount left over after minutes * 60  
  *use Math.floor() to get the final value for each of the above
  -degree symbol: '\xB0'
model: Calculate the degree element first. Then calculate the minutes element. Finally, calculate the seconds element.
examples:
  dms(30);           // 30°00'00"
  dms(76.73);        // 76°43'48"
  dms(254.6);        // 254°35'59"
  dms(93.034773);    // 93°02'05"
  dms(0);            // 0°00'00"
  dms(360);          // 360°00'00" or 0°00'00"
data type: number

****************** Exercise 2 ****************** 
input: two arrays
output: a single array containing all the values, less any duplicate values

several solutions
  ONE
    -combine the arrays
    -iterate through the array, removing any duplicates (requires a nested loop)
  TWO
    -remove duplicates from first array
    -add elements from first array to second array as long as they are not already in the array
    
****************** Exercise 5 ******************
input: two arrays
output: a signle array containing all the values, ordered so that the values from each array alternate
rules:
  -assume the arrays are the same length
  -assume that the arrays are not empty
models:
  -Create a loop that 
  -Loop through both arrays, saving the value in each array to a new array on alternating turns

****************** Exercise 12 ******************
input: time in 24-hour format
output: number of minutes after midnight
Ask: Given a time in 24-hour format, return the number of minutes after midnight
rules:
  -do not use a Date class method
  -value should be in the range of 0..1439
  -disregard Daylight Savings and Standard Time and other irregularities.
model: convert the hours to delta minutes
examples:
  console.log(afterMidnight("00:00") === 0);
  console.log(afterMidnight("12:34") === 754);
  console.log(afterMidnight("24:00") === 0);
data type: number, array
algorithm:
  -convert input to array, where hours is at index 0 and minutes is at index 1
  -convert hours to minutes
    -multiply hours by number of minutes in an hour
  -return hours converted to minutes added to minutes

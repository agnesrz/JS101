**** Exercise 3 ****

Assignment: Write a function that takes a string and returns an object containing three properties:
  one representing the number of characters in the string that are lowercase letters,
  one representing the number of characters that are uppercase letters,
  and one representing the number of characters that are neither.
  
Input: String
Output: Object containing 3 properties (properties represt num of characters that are lowercase, uppercase, and neither)
Algorithm:
  -Create three variables (one for each property). They will represent chars that are lowercase, uppercase, or neither
  -Loop through string. During each iteration:
    -Test to see whether character is lowercase, uppercase, or neither
    -Add 1 to the appropriate variable (the one that represents the value the test returned true for)
  -Create an object
  -Add the properties

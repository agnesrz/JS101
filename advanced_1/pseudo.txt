************** Exercise 2 **************
Input: array of nested arrays that represent a 3x3 matrix
Output: the transpose of the matrix
Rules: 
  -Don't modify the original array
Examples/test cases:
  -here's a matrix:
    1  5  8
    4  7  2
    3  9  6
  -here's the transpose of the matrix
    1  4  3
    5  7  9
    8  2  6

Algorithm:
  -Take the first value from each sub-array to create the first sub-array of the transposed matrix
  -Take the second  value... to create the second sub-array...
  -Take the third value... to create the third sub-array...
